# Joy Ice Creams — Website Redesign

A fresh, immersive redesign for Joy Ice Creams, the pioneering Indian ice cream brand founded in 1948 by L.C. Java. This project rebuilds the legacy site into a modern, responsive experience that celebrates the brand’s history, iconic flavors, and joyful identity.

## Brand Snapshot
- Founded in Mumbai in 1948 by L.C. Java, credited with bringing industrial ice cream to India.
- Known for affordable, quality treats: kulfi, bars, cups, classic cones, and nostalgic flavors (vanilla, strawberry, mango, pista, butterscotch, more).
- Innovator in low-fat options (e.g., “Slimmer”) and one of India’s first franchise models.
- Brand promise: happiness, nostalgia, pure enjoyment—part of everyday moments and celebrations.

## What’s New in This Redesign
- Bold hero and catalog storytelling with high-impact visuals and smoother scroll cues.
- Flavor-forward sections highlighting classics and seasonal specials.
- Clear calls to action for contact, catalog, and franchise interest.
- Mobile-first layout with tailored hero, menu, and about experiences.
- Improved performance basics: optimized assets, modern Next.js App Router, and typography via `next/font`.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router, React, server-side rendering ready)
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Smooth scrolling helpers and responsive navigation components
